            <p>
                ☛ <b>Rabindranath Tagore</b> was a Bengali poet, novelist and painter, best known for being the first
                non-European to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 with his book Gitanjali
                <br><br>
                ☛ <strong>Birth and Pedigree</strong>-Rabindranath Tagore was born on <b> May 1861</b> to Maharshi
                Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi in
                the
                Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta. His nickname was "Rabi" or"Robi". He was the youngest son among thirteen
                childrens. His father was a great Hindu philosopher and
                one of the founders of the religious movement, ‘Brahmo Samaj’. Prince Dwarkanath Tagore was his
                grandfather.<br><br>
                ☛ <strong>Childhood and Early Life</strong>-Tagore was very young when his mother died and since his
                father was away most of the time, he was
                raised by the domestic help. The Tagores were ardent art-lovers who were known throughout the Bengal for
                their dominant influence over Bengali culture and literature. Having been born in such a family, he was
                introduced to the world of theatre, music (both regional folk and Western) and literature from an early
                age.<br><br>
                ☛ <strong>Education</strong>-Rabindranath Tagore was educated at home due to lack interest in going
                Schools. His father sent him to
                Brighton, East Sussex, England when he was at 17 for formal schooling but Rabindranath failed to finish
                his studies. He returned to Bengal in 1880 without a degree, with the aspiration of fusing the elements
                of Bengali and European traditions in his literary works. Rabindranath never attained formal schools and
                colleges or studying and gathered knowledge and education reading at home and became famous by his
                writings.
                <br><br> ☛ <strong>Personal Life</strong>-At the time of the marriage Rabindranath was 22 years old and
                Bhabatarini(Mrinalini Devi) was
                12. They got married on 9 December 1883. Together they had five childrens, but two died during
                childhood. They were Renuka Tagore, Rathindranath Tagore, Meera Tagore, Shamindranath Tagore,
                Madhurilata Tagore.
                <br><br> ☛ <strong>Literary Works</strong>-Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays,
                short stories, travelogues, dramas,
                and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is
                indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently
                noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature.
                <br><br> ☛ <strong>Drama</strong>-Tagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his
                brother Jyotirindranath.
                He wrote his first original dramatic piece when he was twenty — Valmiki Pratibha which was shown at the
                Tagore's mansion. List of dramas are as follow:
            <ol>
                <li>Valmiki Pratibha</li>
                <li>Rudrachanda</li>
                <li>Nalini</li>
                <li>Prakritir Pratisodh</li>
                <li>Raja o Rani</li>
                <li>Chitrangada</li>
                <li>Visarjan etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br> ☛<strong>Short Stories</strong>- Tagore began his career in short stories in 1877—when he was only
            sixteen—with "Bhikharini" ("The
            Beggar Woman"). The four years from 1891 to 1895 are known as Tagore's "Sadhana" period (named for one of
            Tagore's magazines).In particular, such stories as "Kabuliwala" ("The Fruitseller from Kabul", published in
            1892), "Kshudita Pashan" ("The Hungry Stones") (August 1895), and "Atithi" ("The Runaway", 1895) typified
            this analytic focus on the downtrodden. List of short stories are as follow:
            <ol>
                <li>Bhikarini</li>
                <li>Korunna</li>
                <li>Ghater Katha</li>
                <li>Ginni</li>
                <li>Post Master</li>
                <li>Kabuliwallah</li>
                <li>Denapaona etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br> ☛<strong>Novels</strong> - Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them Chaturanga,
            Shesher Kobita, Char Odhay,
            and Noukadubi. Ghare Baire (The Home and the World)—through the lens of the idealistic zamindar protagonist
            Nikhil—excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the Swadeshi movement; a frank
            expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of depression.List of novels are
            as follow:
            <ol>
                <li>Bou Thakuranir Haat</li>
                <li>Rajarshi</li>
                <li>Chokher Bali</li>
                <li>Nastanirh</li>
                <li>Chirakumar Sabha</li>
                <li>Noukadubi</li>
                <li>Gora etc.</li>
            </ol>

            <br><br> <strong>Poetry</strong> - Internationally, Gitanjali is Tagore's best-known collection of poetry,
            for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913. He was influenced by the atavistic mysticism of Vyasa and
            other rishi-authors of the Upanishads, the Bhakti-Sufi mystic Kabir, and Ramprasad Sen. List of poetries are
            as follow:

            <br><br> ☛<strong>Music(Rabindra Sangeet)</strong> - Tagore was also an excellent musician. He wrote around
            2,230 songs. People call these songs "Rabindra Sangeet (which means "Tagore Song" in English). These songs
            are now a part of modern Bengali culture. Tagore's many poems and songs are parts of his novels and stories.
            Among Rabindra Sangeet are two great works, which are now national anthems of two different countries: India
            and Bangladesh. This makes Tagore the only person in the world to have written the national anthems of two
            nations. They are Bangladesh's <b>'Amar Sonaar Baanglaa'</b> and India's <b>'Jana Gana Mana'</b>.
            <br><br> ☛ <strong>Art Works</strong> : Rabindranath Tagore was also an excellent painter who played an
            important role in modernising Bengali art.
            <br><br> ☛ <strong>Awards and Achievements</strong> - For his momentous and revolutionary literary works on
            'Geetanjali', Tagore was honored with the Nobel Prize in Literature on 14 November 1913. He was also
            conferred knighthood in 1915, which he renounced in 1919 after the Jallianwallah Bagh carnage. In 1940,
            Oxford University awarded him with a Doctorate of Literature in a special ceremony arranged at
            Shantiniketan.
            <br><br> ☛ <strong>World Tours</strong> - Between 1878 and 1932, Tagore set foot in more than thirty
            countries on five continents. Since Rabindranath Tagore believed in the concept of one world, he set out on
            a world tour, in an attempt to spread his ideologies.
            <br><br> ☛ <strong>Last Days & Death</strong> - Rabindranath Tagore spent the last four years of his life in
            constant pain and was bogged down by two long bouts of illness. In 1937, he went into a comatose condition,
            which relapsed after a period of three years. After an extended period of suffering, Tagore died on August
            7, 1941 in the same Jorasanko mansion in which he was brought up.
